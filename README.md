This is the repository for the final project in CS 254 (Machine Learning) for Ethan Nerney and Garrett Landen.

It is a computer vision project that will be able to distinguish between 5 different animals:
- Elephant
- Squirrel
- Goat
- Cow
- Butterfly



## Files
At the moment, there are 3 .py files:   
- constants.py:
- compression.py:
    - when run, the output/data folder will populate with a duplicate of the data folder, but with every image being 64x64 pixels.
    
- analysis.py: 
    - intended to plot image data as well as model success data in the future
